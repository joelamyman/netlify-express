    <p class="o-bodyText">This is a game made by me, Joe Lamyman, Interactive Media student at the University of York, as part of my master's thesis. This game allows you to answer questions and create your own e-commerce user interface based on your own needs.</p>

    <h2 class="o-bwText o-bwText__header">Why does this exist?</h2>
    <p class="o-bodyText">This game is part of a student project for my thesis at University of York, UK. The purpose of this game is to understand user preferences and accessibility needs when using user interfaces.</p>
    <p class="o-bodyText">The results from this game will help me to understand features of web user interfaces that can be personalised to enhance web accessibility.</p>
    <p class="o-bodyText">After completing the game, you will be shown a personalised e-commerce website interface, and then asked to complete a short survey hosted by Google Forms to provide me with additional contextual data.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="stack-small">
    <h2 class="o-bwText o-bwText__header">What will happen with the information I provide?</h2>
