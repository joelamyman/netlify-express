  <div class="stack-small">
    <h2 class="o-bwText o-bwText__header">What is this?</h2>
    <p class="o-bodyText">This is a game made by me, Joe Lamyman, Interactive Media student at the University of York, as part of my master's thesis. This game allows you to answer questions and create your own e-commerce user interface based on your own needs.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="stack-small">
    <h2 class="o-bwText o-bwText__header">Why does this exist?</h2>
    <p class="o-bodyText">This game is part of a student project for my thesis at University of York, UK. The purpose of this game is to understand user preferences and accessibility needs when using user interfaces.</p>
    <p class="o-bodyText">The results from this game will help me to understand features of web user interfaces that can be personalised to enhance web accessibility.</p>
    <p class="o-bodyText">After completing the game, you will be shown a personalised e-commerce website interface, and then asked to complete a short survey hosted by Google Forms to provide me with additional contextual data.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="stack-small">
    <h2 class="o-bwText o-bwText__header">What will happen with the information I provide?</h2>
    <p class="o-bodyText">No personal information will be captured from this game. There are no cookies or analytical information being tracked either. After you have completed the game, you will complete an online survey hosted by Google Forms where we will collect some additional information to add context to your choices within the game, as well as demographic data about you. You will have the option to provide your email address to be entered into a prize draw for 1 of 10 Â£20 Amazon vouchers. If you wish to be entered into the prize draw you will need to complete the game and submit the Google Form by 12/09/2020.</p>
    <p class="o-bodyText">The questionnaire will be asking about your accessibility requirements when using websites. As a result, we recognise that this has the potential to be a sensitive topic. The questions relating to this area will not be mandatory, so you do not have to provide an answer. In addition, you may withdraw your participation at any time. If you have not completed your questionnaire yet, this information will not be submitted. If you have already completed your website design, you can email us (details below) with your unique ID to remove your participation. You do not have to provide any reason for doing so, and may remove your participation at any time.</p>
